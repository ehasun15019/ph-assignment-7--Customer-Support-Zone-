    <th>Feature</th>
    <th>Props</th>
    <th>State</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Definition</td>
    <td>Data passed from parent to child component</td>
    <td>Data managed inside the component</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Who owns it?</td>
    <td>Parent component</td>
    <td>The component itself</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can it be changed?</td>
    <td>No (read-only)</td>
    <td>Yes (can be updated with setState/useState)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Purpose</td>
    <td>To pass data and configure a component</td>
    <td>To store information that can change over time</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Example</td>
    <td><code>&lt;User name="Ehasun" /&gt;</code></td>

  </tr>
</table>


Q3. What is the useState hook, and how does it work?

Ans: useState is ReactHook. it's used for managed our state in our functional components

when we use useState it should have a initial value. 
It's gives use tow things 

1. The current state value
2. A function to update that value

    Example: 

        import { useState } from "react";

        function Counter() {
            const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

            return (
                <div>
                <p>Count: {count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
                </div>
            );
        }
