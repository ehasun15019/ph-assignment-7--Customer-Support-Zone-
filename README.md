Q1. What is JSX, and why is it used?

Ans: JSX is JavaScript XML. It's look like HTML but it is actually JavaScript Code..

    Example: 
      
       const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

JSX is used for easy to access UI and more readable

    Example: 

        const name = "Ehasun";
        const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
